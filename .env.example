# Environment Configuration

This project requires environment variables to be set. Copy this file to `.env` in the server directory and fill in the required values.

## Server Environment Variables (server/.env)

```bash
PORT=5000
MONGO_URI=mongodb://localhost:27017/ui-ux-marketplace
OPENAI_API_KEY=your-openai-api-key-here
```

## Getting Your OpenAI API Key

1. Go to [OpenAI Platform](https://platform.openai.com/api-keys)
2. Sign in or create an account
3. Navigate to API Keys section
4. Click "Create new secret key"
5. Copy the key and paste it as the value for `OPENAI_API_KEY`

- Keep your API keys private
- The `.env` file is already in `.gitignore`
